# NearestMe

## Overview
NearestMe is a simple web application built using the Flask microframework in Python.  Users can enter their
address, select their destination type from a pre-defined dropdown menu (gas, coffee, park, etc), and retrieve
the nearest instance of the user query which is displayed in the app.

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to develope my skills as a Python developer and practice simple implementation of
available Google API's.  Size and complexity are kept to a minimum for quick deployment and to build confidence.  Additional features such as geolocation, user authentication, and databases may be added at a later date.
